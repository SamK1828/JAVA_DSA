Description:

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Java, including:

- Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs
- Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Graph Traversal, Dynamic Programming, Backtracking

Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in a separate Java class, with clear documentation and examples. This repository is intended for:

- Beginners looking to learn DSA concepts in Java
- Experienced developers seeking reference implementations
- Anyone preparing for coding interviews or competitive programming

Features:

- Clean, readable, and well-documented code
- Examples and test cases for each implementation
- Regular updates with new data structures and algorithms

Contributions:

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add a new data structure or algorithm, or improve existing code, please submit a pull request.
